Managing a scholarship system for a university. The system maintains records of students, scholarships, 
and the scholarships awarded to students. Managing Transactions with Savepoints and Rollbacks
The database has the following structure:
 Database Tables
*Students* table:
   - StudentID (INT, Primary Key)
   - StudentName (VARCHAR)
   - TotalCredits (INT)
*Scholarships* table:
   - ScholarshipID (INT, Primary Key)
   - ScholarshipName (VARCHAR)
   - Amount (DECIMAL)
*Awards* table:
   - AwardID (INT, Primary Key)
   - StudentID (INT, Foreign Key referencing Students.StudentID)
   - ScholarshipID (INT, Foreign Key referencing Scholarships.ScholarshipID)
   - AwardDate (DATE)
Create a Java program that performs the following operations within a transaction:
1. Register a student for a scholarship by inserting a new record into the Awards table.
2. Deduct the scholarship amount from the student's total credits.
3. Add the scholarship amount to the student's account (assuming another table Accounts for simplicity).
4. If any operation fails, roll back to the previous state using a savepoint.
5. Ensure that if a student's total credits become negative, the transaction should be completely rolled back.
Task 1: Create and Populate Database
Step 1: Write the SQL statements to create the above tables.
Step 2: Populate the tables with the following sample data:

*Students Table:*
csv
StudentID,StudentName,TotalCredits
1,John Doe,30
2,Jane Smith,45
3,Emily Johnson,60
4,Michael Brown,25
5,Jessica White,40


*Scholarships Table:*
csv
ScholarshipID,ScholarshipName,Amount
1,Academic Excellence,1000.00
2,Community Service,500.00
3,Sports Achievement,750.00
4,Arts and Culture,300.00
5,Research Grant,1200.00
*Awards Table:*
csv
AwardID,StudentID,ScholarshipID,AwardDate
1,1,1,2024-01-15
2,2,2,2024-02-20
3,3,3,2024-03-25
4,4,4,2024-04-10
5,5,5,2024-05-05

Task 2: Java Program for Managing Transactions
Create a Java program using JDBC that performs the following operations:
1. Insert a new award record for a student (StudentID = 2) receiving a scholarship (ScholarshipID = 1) on 2024-07-20.
2. Deduct the scholarship amount from the student's total credits.
3. Add the scholarship amount to the student's account in the Accounts table (assume Accounts table has columns StudentID and Balance).
4. Use a savepoint before updating the student's total credits.
5. Roll back to the savepoint if the total credits become negative.
6. Roll back the entire transaction if any operation fails.
